      <h2>Hello, I'm Alena!</h2>
      <p>I'm 29 years old, live West Palm Beach with my beloved husband and our dog. In my early twenties I earned a degree in Computer Science in Germany and have been working as a software engineer for over 6 years. I traveled the world as a 'digital nomad', working remotely for about 3 years and visited over 50 countries. During those travels, I often created small highlight videos of my trips, either with a drone, GoPro, or my phone, as a hobby. Recently, my small family and I decided to settle down in West Palm Beach and I had the opportunity to open a wedding videography. This has been a long-held dream, and I'm 
        thrilled to finally be doing what I love! Thereâ€™s nothing more fulfilling than capturing the essence of a wedding or elopement day and how it truly felt. I'm particularly fond of the "less is more" approach and the beauty of the unexpected. Every wedding video is a unique story, and I am grateful for the chance to tell it through my lens.</p>
