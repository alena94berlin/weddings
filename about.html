      <h2>Hello, I'm Alena!</h2>
      I'm Alena, a 30-year-old wedding videographer based in West Palm Beach, where I live with my husband and our dog. I studied Computer Science in Germany and worked as a software engineer for over 6 years, while also traveling the world as a digital nomad. During those travels, I created highlight videos as a hobby. Now, I've fulfilled my dream by settling down and opening a wedding videography business. I love capturing the true essence of wedding days with a "less is more" approach and an eye for the unexpected. Each video tells a unique story, and I'm grateful to be the one to tell it.

        All packages are customizable, and you can include vows, toasts, and the priest in the audio, along with the music. Let me know what music or style you like, or let me surprise you!
        
        </p>
   <br>Wedding videography services are also available outside of Florida for an additional $500 per package.
